<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A kid always aware of everything around him but ends up not caring about himself is how I would describe myself.
I grew up in a household where everything is mediocre. Nothing ends up being as planned, no plans made done, so on and so forth.
But all my life I know I've got a potential, but I'm always hiding behind the fact that I was just not trained well enough.
Knowing damn well I would've if I showed enough courage.</p>

<p>But I was a kid. Courage for me was just as fun as doing other things. Hence my sports hobby. I've never really hate any kind of sports really.
Muscle and Tendons was always in my genetics. I was... well according to my curriculum, doing excellent. Having the average score of 88 on my high school diploma.
</p>

<p>But I know one day I'll start to wonder, "Would this piece of paper and every single score I've worked so hard for really matters for me?" It was more like a "when?" question rather than doubting that it would.</p>

<p>Well, to be exact, school really did teach us something, well to learn, of course. But after spending all 12 years worth of money, they end up letting us go like an extinct wild animal finally released to the wild world. Finally, I'd realize it's all on me to grab on and choose a path. And even after that, finally, you'd realize you're just trying to survive.
