<h1>Fran's Set</h1>
<p>A Comprehensive List of My Favorite Movies (of a kind)</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Interstellar</h2>
<p>Directed by Christopher Nolan, no judge of the quality of every single movies he's ever made. It's top tier. <br />
Sci-fi has always been so interesting to me personally, It tops my brain into thinking that me as a human being <br />
is alive.</p>

<h2>2. Coco</h2>
<p>This movie's theme was based off of an event on real life in Mexico, named DÃ­a de los Muertos, or often referred as <br />
Day of the Dead. Coco was my only disney movie that I really appreciate because of the music it presents.</p>

<h2>3. The Pianist</h2>
<p>While I see alot of movies often cannot project enough gore-ness or even often times too gore-y for audience, The Pianist<br />
is a movie based on a real tragedy that happened during World War 2. It portrays hopelessness in such a manner it hurts.<br />
But then in the state of such scarcity and lack of kindness, the protagonist found hope.</p>
